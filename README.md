# ðŸ§™ Handalf

*I only uploaded this so that it may serve as inspiration. It is still 
being tweaked. The README may not completely match the implementation. 
It currently only supports Linux.*

Touch typing on a standard keyboard could be better. Your thumbs idle 
while your weakest finger contorts to reach keys like <kbd>Esc</kbd> and 
<kbd>BkSp</kbd>. Numbers and other common symbols require you to abandon 
a comfortable hand position entirely. Exotic keyboards can remedy all 
this, but lack portability.

Handalf is a keyboard layout that works well for fancy keyboards with 2 
or more thumb keys per hand, but it *also* fits broadly within the 
constraints of a laptop keyboard.

![The Handalf keyboard layout on top of a Qwerty layout.](handalf.svg)

-   **Each finger travels one key at most.** Your thumbs pick up the 
    slack.
-   **Graceful degradation.** You can keep a somewhat consistent layout 
    even when you're stuck on a laptop keyboard. Only the backslash key 
    <kbd>\\</kbd> is used slightly differently.
-   **Easy to learn & remember.** The alpha keys won't change from 
    whatever layout you already use, and all other symbols are 
    accessible with *only* the <kbd>AltGr</kbd> modifier. There is a 
    *single* additional layer beyond that, for navigation and function 
    keys. There's no need to learn it all at once; I've found the 
    symbols under <kbd>AltGr</kbd> to be the most ergonomically 
    significant.
-   **No homerow mods.** While typing at speed, keypresses will often 
    overlap, which means that any attempt at overloading alpha keys must 
    resort to timeouts. This introduces [visual delay][pftwp] and can 
    cause misfires. You can train yourself and there are other 
    [ways][urob] to mitigate it, but I have not made such sacrifices 
    here.
-   **Overloading is used sparingly.** Even on non-alpha keys, 
    overloading has the above downsides, albeit to a lesser degree. 
    Therefore, only *one* key has two functions, because it tends to 
    punctuate a keystroke anyway: <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
-   **Stateless.** Modal editing is great, but you shouldn't need to 
    remember what state your keyboard is in. The key that your software 
    sees will depend only on what keys you are *currently* pressing, or 
    at most which keys you were pressing some fraction of a second ago.
-   **Regressions are avoided.** When stuffing so much functionality 
    into a limited space, it is inevitable that some key sequences will 
    become hard to type. However, care has been taken to avoid making 
    assumptions about the programs you will be running. That is, all 
    modifier combinations should still be available, they should still 
    stack in an intuitive and consistent way, and no reasonable shortcut 
    should be made impossible to type.

Above all, the layout should **feel good**. Many things are taken into 
consideration: simplicity, rolling motions, muscle memory, semantic 
clustering, symmetry, keeping actions and symbols separate, etcetera --- 
but the final decision is based on vibes. :)

Unfortunately, the layout is biased toward right-handed people.


## Symbol keys

![The symbol portion of the Handalf keyboard layout.](handalf-symbols.svg)

If you are currently using US Colemak or Workman or good ol' 
Qwerty/Azerty, then all alpha keys will stay in the same place. The 
major addition is that the **Level-3** symbols on those keys (accessed 
through <kbd>AltGr</kbd>) have been crammed full with numbers and the 
other ASCII symbols for which you would normally have had contort your 
hands.

<!-- Because AltGr is pressed with your right-hand thumb, the left-hand 
side of the keyboard is preferred for things like parentheses, while the 
number pad can now be operated entirely with your right-hand. -->


## Action keys

![The action portion of the Handalf keyboard layout.](handalf-action.svg)

The key to the left of <kbd>Space</kbd>, what would have been your 
<kbd>Alt</kbd>, is now the Action key (written <kbd>&#9680;</kbd>), 
which exposes the **Nav-Fn** layer that hold the navigation cluster and 
F-keys. Tragically, this layer has been split in twain.

[^1]: *Meta* is also sometimes referred to as the *Super*, *Windows*, 
*OS* or *GUI*-key.

- In principle, <kbd>&#9680;</kbd> accesses the **Nav/Meta** layer. 
  Here, the navigation cluster is placed so that you can control the 
  directional keys with only your left hand. The bottom row has 
  programmable keys. The right-hand side remains unchanged, except for 
  the activation of the <kbd>Meta</kbd> modifier, handy for mapping 
  actions in your window manager.

- This is flipped around by also holding <kbd>Space</kbd>: then the 
  layer becomes **Meta/Fn**, in which the *left*-hand side holds 
  <kbd>Meta</kbd>-augmented keys and the *right*-hand side has your 
  F-keys.

- Just tapping <kbd>Space</kbd> will emit <kbd>Meta</kbd> on its own, 
  which plays well with the convention, as established in multiple OSes 
  and DEs, of having <kbd>Meta</kbd> bring up a global menu.

This criss-crossed approach is an aesthetic sacrifice, worth it for the 
practical convenience it brings. After all, the F-keys are not often 
used in modern applications. And while it is useful to reserve some 
<kbd>Meta</kbd> keys for frictionless window manager bindings, half a 
keyboard should be plenty for that purpose.

<!--
<kbd>Space</kbd>, being a thumb key and having no associations with any 
other modifier, is the obvious choice for switching between these two 
half-layers.
-->

## Other tricks

### Overloading escape

The <kbd>&#9680;</kbd> key occupies a very accessible location. Since it 
does not map to a conventional key, we can choose an additional key on 
tap. The default is <kbd>Esc</kbd>, which is perfect if you use modal 
applications like Vim --- as you likely do, if you are reading this.


### Sticky modifiers

<kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>AltGr</kbd> are modifiers, but unlike 
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>, they don't access shortcuts --- they 
simply provide more symbols. To make for a more comfortable typing 
experience, these keys are made *sticky* (or *oneshot*). Instead of 
holding and consciously releasing them *just* before pressing the next 
unmodified key, you can just tap once and forget about it. MUch better!


### Shift on a standard keyboard

You may have noticed that <kbd>Shift</kbd> is on your right-hand thumb, 
but on a laptop keyboard, that's just <kbd>Space</kbd>! The compromise 
is as unobtrusive as possible:

<kbd>Shift</kbd> will retain its function at the bottom-left of the 
keyboard, but, when combined with <kbd>AltGr</kbd> or a preceding tap of 
<kbd>Shift</kbd>, it becomes a backslash <kbd>\\</kbd>. If you keep 
holding it, the associated <kbd>Shift</kbd> modifier will also stay 
active.

Because the backslash is commonly used for escaping characters, it will 
often be followed by a special character, meaning that you will usually 
need to activate the <kbd>AltGr</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> anyway. In 
this way, we retain an easily accessible <kbd>Shift</kbd> on generic 
keyboards, without wasting a good spot for a useful symbol key.


### Backspace

<kbd>BkSp</kbd> takes the place of <kbd>CapsLk</kbd>, avoiding the huge 
move your pinky would have made.


### CapsLock and NumLock

Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> on its own gets you <kbd>CapsLk</kbd> and 
holding <kbd>AltGr</kbd> gets you <kbd>NumLk</kbd>.


### Compose

The <kbd>Multi</kbd> key (also called *Compose*) allows you to type 
special characters by typing intuitive keys in succession. For example, 
<kbd>Multi</kbd><kbd>c</kbd><kbd>=</kbd> becomes `â‚¬`. This key has been 
placed at the position of <kbd>ShiftR</kbd>.


### Right modifier variants

In general, it doesn't matter whether you press the right or left 
variant of a modifier, so we choose the left arbitrarily. However, some 
tasks, like pulling up a menu or escaping a virtual machine sometimes 
involves tapping a specific modifier on the right side. This is 
accommodated by pressing that modifier in the **Nav/Meta** layer.

<!--
You will often need a decimal point while typing numbers, but it is 
cumbersome to exit the symbol layer just to grab one and return. The 
same holds for the underscore when typing in all-caps. For this reason, 
double-tapping <kbd>Space</kbd> while holding <kbd>AltGr</kbd> will emit 
a decimal point (resulting in `.` or `,` depending on your locale), and 
doing so while holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> will emit an underscore `_`. 
**(TODO)**
-->
<!--
You will usually use the arrows in the **Nav/Meta** layer while typing a 
sentence, but if you continue typing quickly, the **Meta** portion may 
still be active. For this reason, the right half will be disabled when 
pressing something in the **Nav/Meta** layer some milliseconds after 
using the arrow keys. **(TODO)**
-->

### Optional: Bonus modifiers

If you do not have the thumb keys for <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and 
<kbd>Alt</kbd>, you may want to consider the Pinky tweak.

While in the **Meta/Nav** layer, the keys on your pinky, 
<kbd>&#9680;</kbd><kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>&#9680;</kbd><kbd>z</kbd>, turn 
into sticky <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> keys, respectively. Try 
it --- it makes it very easy to type common shortcuts like 
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>c</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>f</kbd>.

However, this tweak is optional, because hiding a modifier behind 
another key violates our design principles. Stack more modifiers on top, 
and you will need to pause your typing to think about it.

That said, the tweak is very useful, so the keys it overrides are 
deliberately chosen to be expendable: <kbd>Prog4</kbd> is 
user-programmable and <kbd>Esc</kbd> can also be produced by combining 
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with the tap-action on the action key.


## Keysyms

When you press a key, your keyboard will send a *scancode* to the 
computer; the kernel maps that to a *keycode*; and finally, your 
keyboard layout considers that keycode (along with the active modifiers) 
and emits a *keysym*.

By default, Handalf remaps *symbols* at this keysym level, while other 
keys are mapped at the scan- or keycode-level. Teasing the two apart 
like this has several benefits:

- At the scan- and keycode-level, more tricks can be applied, like 
  overloading.
- But at the keysym-level, your OS is aware of your active layout. You 
  can switch between them in the standard way, with some visual 
  indication.
- It becomes easier to reason about key composition. We don't have to 
  explicitly write and remember rules for how layers and modifiers 
  combine. Suppose, for example, you want to type 
  <kbd>Meta</kbd><kbd>1</kbd>: the first key would be <kbd>&#9680;</kbd> 
  and the second would be <kbd>AltGr</kbd><kbd>n</kbd>.
- For layout-independent keybindings in your window manager, it is 
  important that emitted keycodes stay the same even as symbols change.

Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>AltGr</kbd> together does not change 
the keysyms, but it does change the keycode. This is helpful in 
applications that read keycodes rather than keysyms, or when you use a 
system in which the layout is not installed.


## Usage and installation

Install [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd) (version >=2.3) and run 
`sudo make install`. Activate the `handalf` layout in your environment.


## Notes

A tap on the <kbd>Meta</kbd> key brings up a global menu in many 
environments. While this is easy to do in Handalf with the 
<kbd>Action</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd> combination, consider putting a global 
menu on <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> instead. In Sway or i3, that would be something 
like:

    bindsym --no-repeat --release Control_L exec ...

## Other

[Seniply] and [Callum] have similar goals: limited keys and no home-row 
mods.

# Consideration for the thumb keys

-   All thumb keys except space are modifiers or layer keys, because you 
    have full range of motion with the rest of your fingers while 
    holding them.
-   Since we avoid crazy modifier combinations, `sym` and `shift` never 
    make sense to press together. Therefore, they should be on the same 
    finger.
-   `space` should be opposite from  `shift` and `sym`, so that you can 
    still use it while in their respective modes.
