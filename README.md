# xkb-ergonomics

Disregarding issues with posture, there huge ergonomic problems with the *layout* of standard keyboards. The most glaring of these is, in my opinion, the lack of a split spacebar, which forces one of your thumbs to idle around while your weakest finger contorts to reach Control, Backspace and Enter. The addition of a second thumb key on keyboards would not demand *anything* of users, while providing massive potential benefit.

But alas: we have to work with what we've got. Although I have been enticed by exotic keyboards like the Kinesis Advantage, what has held me back is portability: you'd have to lug around a secondary keyboard wherever you go. Besides, I wouldn't advocate chucking those suboptimal keyboards in the landfill, either.

## Goals

So, I tried to come up with a keyboard layout that *makes sense*. The constraints for this were:

- Achievable using any run-of-the-mill keyboard.
- Only using standard tools --- for which I use the Debian repositories as a measuring stick.
- Use only keys that would be available on any 65% keyboard. Special function keys are devilish contraptions that are different everywhere, requiring you to fumble around finding them.
- Layers are useful, but don't go overboard. Ideally, there should be only *one* layer.
