# WORKAROUND: Double tapping space while holding shift/altgr (thus entering
# doublespace) should not keep altgr/shift active unless altgr/shift is
# actually still pressed. This is why we add shift2/altgr2 layers whose only
# purpose is to avoid triggering the continued activation of modifiers during
# oneshots. This is not perfect but it avoids the most egregious issues
