# This tweak overloads the `esc` key (at the position of the `z` key on the
# _Nav/Meta_ layer) to act as a `ctrl` key when held. This gives you a
# comfortable way to type `ctrl+{c,v,s,f,p,d}` without an easy-to-reach dedicated
# thumb control key, at the expense of some of the beauty and simplicity of the
# vanilla layout.

# We use a `Control` layer overlaid on the currently active layer, because
# there is no oneshotswap or overloadswap (see issue
# <https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd/issues/673>)
