# ðŸ§™ Handalf

*I only uploaded this so that it may serve as inspiration. It is still 
being tweaked. It currently only supports Linux.*

Touch typing on a standard keyboard is not a great experience. Your 
thumbs idle while your weakest finger contorts to reach keys like 
<kbd>Esc</kbd> and <kbd>BkSp</kbd>. Numbers and other common symbols 
require you to abandon a comfortable hand position entirely. Exotic 
keyboards can remedy all this, but lack portability.

Handalf is a keyboard layout that works well for fancy keyboards with 2 
or more thumb keys per hand, but that *also* fit broadly within the 
constraints of a laptop keyboard.

-   **Each finger travels one key at most.** Your thumbs pick up the slack.
-   **Easy to remember.** All symbols are accessible with just the 
    normal <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>AltGr</kbd> modifiers. There is 
    only *one* additional layer for navigation and function keys â€” and 
    that's it.
-   **One-handed control.** The number pad can be operated with just the 
    right hand. Navigation keys and shortcuts like 
    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>c</kbd> can be reached with just the left, 
    freeing your hand for the mouse. Unfortunately, this also means that 
    the layout is biased towards right-handed people.
-   **Graceful degradation.** You can keep a somewhat consistent layout 
    even when you're stuck on a mainstream keyboard. Only 
    <kbd>Multi</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> are in a truly different spot.
-   **Incremental learning.** You don't need to learn everything all at 
    once. I've found the <kbd>AltGr</kbd> symbols to be the most 
    ergonomically significant, so that is a great place to start.
-   **Regressions are avoided.** When stuffing so much functionality in 
    a limited space, it is inevitable that some key sequences will 
    become hard to generate. However, care has been taken to make few 
    assumptions about the programs you will be running. That is, all 
    modifiers should still stack in an intuitive and consistent way, and 
    no reasonable shortcut should be impossible or cumbersome to type.
-   **Good feeling.** Muscle memory, simplicity, semantic clustering, 
    and symmetry are all taken into consideration --- but above all, 
    keys are placed in such a way that they *feel* good: they encourage 
    rolling motions, have common symbols in easy-to-reach spots, do not 
    mix action keys with letter keys, try to avoid layer switching, 
    etcetera.
-   **No homerow mods.** While typing at speed, keypresses will often 
    overlap, which means that any attempt at overloading alpha keys must 
    resort to timeouts. This introduces [visual delay][pftwp] and can 
    cause misfiring. There are [ways][urob] to mitigate this and train 
    yourself to work with it, but I have not made that sacrifice here.
-   **Overloading is used sparingly.** Even on non-alpha keys, 
    overloading has the above downsides, albeit to a lesser degree. 
    Therefore, only *one* key has been overloaded: <kbd>Esc</kbd> 
    accesses a layer when held. This is considered safe because `Esc` 
    tends to punctuate a keystroke and a misfire is not catastrophic. 
    The `Esc` is only registered when the tap is short.
-   **Stateless.** Well, almost. You shouldn't need to remember what 
    'mode' your keyboard is in: all symbols depend only on what keys you 
    are *currently* pressing, or perhaps which keys you were pressing 
    some fraction of a second ago.


## Arrow keys

Tricks can be handy, but they must not require conscious thought. For 
example: you will usually use the arrow keys while typing a sentence, 
but the next key may overlap with the activation of Fn. For this reason, 
the Super modifier will be disabled when pressing something in the `Fn` 
layer some milliseconds after using the arrow keys.


## Symbols

![The Handalf-qwerty keyboard layout.](kb-qwerty.svg)

Are you currently using a Qwerty layout or similar? Then there isn't 
much of a barrier to entry: in the standard variant, all characters stay 
in the same place. The major addition is that the Level-3 symbols 
(accessed through <kbd>AltGr</kbd>) have been crammed full with numbers 
and the other ASCII symbols for which you would normally have had 
contort your hands.

<!-- Symbols were placed according to how often I personally need them, 
drawing inspiration from the [Workman] layout on which keys to assign 
preference.

Because AltGr is pressed with your right-hand thumb, the left-hand side 
of the keyboard is preferred for things like parentheses, while the 
number pad can now be controlled entirely with your right-hand. -->

- <kbd>BkSp</kbd> takes the place of <kbd>Caps</kbd>, avoiding the huge 
  move your pinky would have made.

- <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>AltGr</kbd> are modifiers, but unlike 
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>, they don't access shortcuts â€” they 
  simply provide more symbols. To make for a more comfortable typing 
  experience, these keys are made *sticky* (or *oneshot*). Instead of 
  holding and consciously releasing them *just* before pressing the next 
  unmodified key, you can just tap once and forget about it. MUch 
  better!

- Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>AltGr</kbd> together does not change 
  the keysyms, but it does change the keycode.

- You will often need a decimal point while typing numbers, but it is 
  cumbersome to exit the numpad just to grab one and return. A similar 
  observation can be made for the underscore when typing in all-caps. 
  For this reason, double-tapping <kbd>Space</kbd> while holding 
  <kbd>AltGr</kbd> will emit a decimal point (resulting in `.` or `,` 
  depending on your locale), and doing so while holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> 
  will emit an underscore `_`.

- The <kbd>Multi</kbd> key (also called *Compose*) allows you to type 
  special characters by typing intuitive keys in succession. For 
  example, <kbd>Multi</kbd><kbd>c</kbd><kbd>=</kbd> becomes `â‚¬`.

## Sfift

We need a clever way to compromise on the lack of thumb keys on a laptop 
keyboard, in as unobtrusive a way as possible. My solution is the 
following:

Ideally, the bottom-left key will be the backslash, but on a laptop, 
this key will retain its function as <kbd>Shift</kbd>. In the Shift- and 
AltGr-layers, it is then *also* a backslash. That is, double tapping 
<kbd>Shift</kbd>, or tapping while holding <kbd>AltGr</kbd>, will get 
you `\`, and if you keep holding the key, the associated Shift modifier 
will stay active.

Because `\` is often for escaping, it will normally be combined with 
special characters, and thus, you would have needed to activate 
<kbd>AltGr</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> *anyway*. In this way, we retain an 
easily accessible <kbd>Shift</kbd> on generic keyboards, including 
oneshot behaviour, without wasting a good spot for a useful symbol key. 

The same reasoning goes for the compose key on the opposite edge.


## Escape

![The action portion of the Handalf keyboard layout.](kb-action.svg)

<kbd>Esc</kbd> is given an easily accessible spots for your left thumb, 
since it is useful for modal applications like Vim. However, when you 
*hold it*, it reveals a **Fn** layer with the remaining 'action' keys: a 
navigation cluster, F-keys, and modifiers.

- Pressing space while in this layer turns it into *Meta* (also 
  sometimes referred to as the *Super*, *Windows*, *OS* or *GUI*-key). 
  This plays well with the convention of bringing up some sort of menu 
  upon tapping *Meta*.

- Admittedly, the above is a simplification. In the **Fn** layer, the 
  navigation cluster is placed so that you can control the directional 
  keys with only your left hand. On the other hand (literally), the 
  F-keys are not often used in modern applications. That is why holding 
  the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key brings up the **Fn**-layer only on the *left* 
  side, whereas the *right* side instead exposes *Meta*-keys, easily 
  accessible for mapping actions in your window manager. When you *also* 
  hold *Space*, this is flipped around, as the left-hand *Meta*-keys and 
  right-hand F-keys are exposed. This is, in my opinion, the most 
  distressing aspect of the layout, but it is worth it for the practical 
  convenience it brings.

- The keys labeled <kbd>Alt</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> activate the 
  corresponding modifier for any subsequent keypress that occurs shortly 
  after, or until you release the key.
    - In general, the **Fn** layer is deactivated while a modifier is 
      active, so that, for example, 
      <kbd>Esc</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>f</kbd> will generate 
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>f</kbd>. If you instead really do mean to 
      combine a modifier with a key from the **Fn** layer, simply enter 
      the layer again while holding the modifier key.
    - Pulling up a menu or escaping a virtual machine sometimes involves 
      tapping a modifier on its own --- this is achieved by holding it 
      on its own for a little longer.

# Suggested tweaks

- Swap the overload to Esc to an overload to Meta.
- Swap the left/right halves of **Nav/Meta** and **Meta/Fn** so that you 
  get only a **Nav/Fn** and **Meta** layer.

# Technical considerations

When you press a key, your keyboard will send a *scancode* to the 
computer; the kernel maps that to a *keycode*; and finally, your 
keyboard layout considers that keycode (along with the active modifiers) 
and emits a *keysym*.

Handalf remaps *symbols* at this keysym level, while other keys are 
mapped at the scan- or keycode-level. Teasing the two apart like this 
has several benefits:

- At the scan- and keycode-level, more tricks can be applied, like 
  overloading.
- But at the keysym-level, you can switch between symbol layouts in the 
  standard way --- and they will apply to all keyboards, regardless of 
  firmware.
- Users can try the <kbd>AltGr</kbd> symbols, without committing to the 
  rest.
- It becomes easier to reason to reason about key composition. We don't 
  have to explicitly write and remember rules for how the various layers 
  and modifiers combine. Suppose, for example, you want to zoom in with 
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>+</kbd> --- you can rely on your muscle memory to 
  type that first key as <kbd>Esc</kbd><kbd>a</kbd> and the second as 
  <kbd>AltGr</kbd><kbd>e</kbd>.
- For layout-independent keybindings in your window manager, it is 
  important that emitted keycodes stay the same even as symbols change.


## Usage and installation

## Other

[Seniply] and [Callum] have similar goals: limited keys and no home-row 
mods.

# Consideration for the thumb keys

-   All thumb keys except space are modifiers or layer keys, because you 
    have full range of motion with the rest of your fingers while 
    holding them.
-   Since we avoid crazy modifier combinations, `sym` and `shift` never 
    make sense to press together. Therefore, they should be on the same 
    finger.
-   `space` should be opposite from  `shift` and `sym`, so that you can 
    still use it while in their respective modes.
